      <h1 class="heading">Dealing with the new Coronavirus: Best practices</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Dealing with the new Coronavirus may seem overwhenlming and difficult,
        but the truth is everyone can contribute to fight against this deadly
        pandemic.There are a few things that we can do to help our health care
        system from collapsing and to protect our communities. Below are a few
        things that you can do to make a difference in the lives of people you
        may not know;
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="subHeading">Social Distancing:</span>
        It adhere to deliberately maintaining a distance of upto 6 feet from
        people in order to stop spreading the virus. This means going out to
        crowded places for pleasure such as restaurants, parks and other
        recreational activities should be avoided at all costs. Maintaining
        social distance will help to show down the spread of illness, ultimately
        protecting lives and reducing the burden on the health care system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="subHeading">Self Quarantine:</span> If a person has
        travelled from a place that has confirmed patients of Covid-19, or it is
        possible that he/she has been exposed to the Virus due to an infected
        person around them, it is recommended for them to isolate themselves for
        15-days at least. The symptoms of Coronavirus can be seen within this
        period. This helps in reducing exposure of others to the illness. Once
        the period of self-quarantine ends, it is better to consult the
        healthcare providers about going back to normal routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="subHeading">Isolation:</span> If a person has symptoms such
        as cough, fever or sore throat, then he/she should refrain from going
        out in public, instead staying at home or in a healthcare facility and
        limiting social interaction would be the best choice. Special protective
        equipment and strict procedures/protocols are used to take care of
        patients suffering from Covid-19. This will reduce the spread of the
        disease to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="subHeading">Flattening the Curve:</span> This refers to
        being careful and taking precautions in order to avoid a lot of people
        conducting the new Coronavirus, so that the helthcare system does not
        collapse; hospitals have beds, supplies and availability of doctors to
        treat patients i.e Flattening the Curve. If a huge number of people fall
        sick, it would be difficult for doctors to treat so many patients at the
        same time, especially when treatment of Covid-19 requires numerous
        protocols and safety measures.
